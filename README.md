# Cognitive Radio Research 2018
**About**
This is where I will post all C++ code, MATLAB functions, and MATLAB scripts that were developed throughout my research with Dr. Payam Nayeri into cognitive radios, particularly in the area of energy-based spectrum sensing. We would like to acquire actual data through Nuand's bladeRF x40, spectrum analyzer, and a filtenna, and compare the results with theoretical values from multiple IEEE papers. All files in the repository will be updated on a weekly basis.

**Instructions to run the code**
